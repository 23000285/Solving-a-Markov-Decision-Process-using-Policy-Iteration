# Solving a Markov Decision Process using Policy Iteration

## Aim

To implement the Policy Iteration algorithm for solving a finite Markov Decision Process using the Gymnasium FrozenLake-v1 environment, by repeatedly performing policy evaluation and policy improvement to obtain the optimal value function and optimal policy.

---

## Problem Statement

In this experiment, the `FrozenLake-v1` environment is solved using the **Policy Iteration** algorithm.

The agent starts from the start state and must reach the goal state without falling into holes. The environment is represented as a finite Markov Decision Process. Policy Iteration is used to repeatedly evaluate the current policy and improve it until the policy becomes stable.

The objective is to find:

1. The optimal state-value function $V^*(s)$
2. The optimal policy $pi^*(s)$

## Software Requirements

```bash
pip install gymnasium numpy
```

## Environment Description

The experiment uses the Gymnasium `FrozenLake-v1` environment.

FrozenLake is a grid-world environment where the agent moves over frozen tiles and tries to reach the goal without falling into holes.

For the default 4 × 4 FrozenLake map:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Environment | `FrozenLake-v1` |
| Map size | 4 × 4 |
| Observation space | 16 discrete states |
| Action space | 4 discrete actions |
| Actions | 0 = Left, 1 = Down, 2 = Right, 3 = Up |
| Reward | +1 for reaching the goal, 0 otherwise |
| Terminal states | Goal and hole states |

## Theory

Policy Iteration is a Dynamic Programming method used to find the optimal policy of a Markov Decision Process.

It consists of two major steps:

1. **Policy Evaluation**
2. **Policy Improvement**

These two steps are repeated until the policy becomes stable.

---

## Policy Evaluation

Policy evaluation estimates the value function for the current policy.

The Bellman expectation equation is:

$$
V^\pi(s) =
\sum_a \pi(a \mid s)
\sum_{s'} P(s' \mid s,a)
\left[
R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')
\right]
$$

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $s$ | Current state |
| $a$ | Action |
| $s'$ | Next state |
| $pi(a \mid s)$ | Probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$ |
| $P(s' \mid s,a)$ | Transition probability |
| $R(s,a,s')$ | Reward |
| $gamma$ | Discount factor |
| $V^\pi(s)$ | Value of state $s$ under policy $pi$ |

---

## Policy Improvement

Policy improvement updates the policy greedily with respect to the current value function.

The improved policy is obtained as:

$$
\pi'(s) =
\arg\max_a
\sum_{s'} P(s' \mid s,a)
\left[
R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')
\right]
$$

If the improved policy is the same as the old policy, the policy is considered stable.

## Algorithm

1. Create the Gymnasium `FrozenLake-v1` environment.
2. Initialize a random policy.
3. Repeat until the policy becomes stable:
   - Evaluate the current policy using iterative policy evaluation.
   - Improve the policy greedily using the current value function.
   - Compare the old policy and the new policy.
4. Stop when the policy does not change.
5. Display the optimal value function and optimal policy.
